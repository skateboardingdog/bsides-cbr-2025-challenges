  NOTE: This challenge involves the CTF banner (out the front of the exhibition hall). Wrap the solution word in `skbdg{}` when submitting the flag.

  HINT: Many of you have submitted the _six character_ cluephrase for the second part of the puzzle as the flag. If this is you, consider how the dog and skateboard change moving along the path. Extraction uses A0Z25.
