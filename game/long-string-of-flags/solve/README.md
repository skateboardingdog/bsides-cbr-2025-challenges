Near the top right of the skate park area, there is a string of flags each with
a letter on it. The first few letters clearly indicate the flag format.
Extrapolating that the remaining characters are clipped by the camera, the
remaining characters can found by viewing the network tab in browser dev tools
when loading into the skate park.
