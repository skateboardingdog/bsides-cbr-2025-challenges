  The druid casts a spell, summoning a growling beast. In this moment, you think you can understand what it is saying.

  Flag format: Wrap the four English words in `skbdg{}`, e.g. `skbdg{word1-word2-word3-word4}`.

  HINT: This is the string of 4 words uttered by the human that is summoned when you interact with the druid dog on the right side. This is a phonetics puzzle, and it is recommended to download the GIF to look at each sound the human is making. Additionally, we've attached a GIF of the same human saying "skateboarding dog".
